msgid "﻿De Dublin, Irlande"
msgstr ""

msgid "The letter came on a Tuesday. Jim saw it from the landing as he got ready to come down the stairs that morning. The metal jaw of the letterbox had snapped shut on one corner of the envelope and held it suspended against the inside of the door, looking unnaturally white in the gloom of the hall. Jim frowned. He couldn’t think of the last time he’d had a letter. It was years since his eldest son had arranged to take care of all the bills and now hardly anything came through that letterbox any more. Even Christmas cards and birthday cards were always delivered by hand, as if the senders wanted to make sure he was still alive to receive them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Taking a firm grip on the bannister, Jim, bent one leg a little and carefully slid the other foot down onto the first step. Dot one carry one. He kept his eyes on the envelope and his hand firmly on the bannister as he repeated the procedure for the next step. All his life, he never thought he’d be frightened of stairs, but he was. He was terrified of a fall. One slip and he would end up in a tangle of limbs at the bottom of the stairs. He was old and brittle and he knew he wouldn’t survive it. He had visions of dying alone and in pain down there in the hall. Of his lifeless body being found in a few days, bloated and swollen and twisted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Half way down he had to stop for a rest. His daughter had wanted him to get a stair lift installed but the house was too old; the stairs too narrow and the landing too small. Too old, like myself, he thought, his tired head drooping. Arthritis, angina, emphysema, they’d eaten all the easiness out of things. But what could he expect at his age? Ninety four years old, he was. He’d never have believed it when he was younger. Ninety four would have seemed an impossible age, and yet here he was, a long way from that little bundle of noise and hunger born in the corner of a tenement room."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another few steps and he stopped again. Nearly there, he thought, swaying a little on his feet. He shifted his grip on the bannister and noted with a professional eye that the paint was wearing through. A long smooth streak of green edged with yellow had appeared in the brown. He smiled to himself when he saw the green. He’d been a painter all his working life and he must have painted thousands of houses, but that was the one job he’d never forget. Dark Emerald, that colour was called. He’d got four tins of it left over from a job with the council. The three kids had just been big enough to help and he’d given them each a jamjar full of paint and a small brush and they’d worked along side of him one long summer evening, painting the hall, stairs and landing. It was the little things, he thought now. Memories like that were what kept him living in this house. The kids wanted him to move out now. They wanted him to go to a nursing home, but he couldn’t face that. There would be nothing for him there, nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Two more steps and he was finally standing on the cracked linoleum of the hall. After steadying himself for a moment he reached across and tugged the letter from the stiff jaws of the letterbox. He turned it over and frowned at the address. Only when he held it at arms length did it come into focus:"

msgid "Well, it was for him all right, no question about that. He turned around and shuffled down the narrow hall into the small kitchen. The room was half dark, lit by the glow of morning light through the curtains. Jim switched on the light and placed the letter on the table. He would read it over his breakfast, he thought, and went to put the kettle on. But he had barely lit the gas before he was overcome by curiosity. He turned back to the table and picked up a knife and slit the envelope. Taking his glasses from his shirt pocket, he slipped them on and read:"

msgid "I trust this letter finds you well. It is with great pleasure that I write to inform you that the International Socialist Society has awarded you the Gold Medal for lifetime achievement in the field of Worker’s rights. As the last surviving member of the Irish contingent to the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, we are pleased to award you this medal in order to commemorate both your own sacrifice and that of the comrades who went before you."

msgid "The annual congress of the International Socialist Society will take place this year in Athens, Greece. We would be honoured if you could attend in person to accept the award on behalf of both yourself and your deceased comrades. As you are no doubt aware, this year marks the 75th anniversary of the start of the war against fascism in Spain and we believe it would be particularly appropriate to mark that occasion by presenting the award to you. If you are unable to attend then we would be happy to present the medal to a friend or relative who will accept the award on your behalf."

msgid "Jim read the letter twice. The second time, his hand was shaking. Behind him, the kettle had started to boil; it’s shrieking whistle reverberating around the tiny kitchen. But he hardly heard it."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Ah no,’ he said, and put the letter down quickly, as if it had burned him. But he couldn’t take his eyes off it. ‘Ah no,’ he said again, swaying on his feet. ‘Ah dear me, no.’"
msgstr ""

msgid "Jim was still sitting in the kitchen when Martha let herself in through the front door. Martha was his home help, a short, bustling Filipino woman who came twice a week to cook and clean and check up on him. When Jim heard the thump of the door and the patter of her feet in the hallway, he leaned forward a little and caught a glimpse of a blue coat being shucked off small shoulders."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Hola, señor Jim!’ Martha called out, to let him know it was she."
msgstr ""

msgid " ‘Hola, Martha,’ he answered, half-heartedly. Speaking Spanish was a sort of game between them, but he was in no humor for it now."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Como esta?’ Martha asked, coming into the kitchen and squeezing his shoulder as she passed. She was a tiny woman but energetic and nimble and always smiling. She was dressed in jeans and sneakers and a baggy woolen jersey and her jet-black hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail."
msgstr ""

msgid "Jim didn’t answer. He hadn’t made any breakfast, but had just turned off the gas under the kettle and sat down at the table with the letter open in front of him. He’d thought he’d never had to think about that again. It was so long ago – seventy-five years, it said in the letter, a lifetime for most people. He’d thought it was over, gone, long forgotten about. But maybe that was because he’d tried so hard to forget about it himself. He’d never spoken about to his family – though Mary had known, of course. He’d never been to any of the commemorations or joined the associations. Apart from one or two times over the years, he’d managed to push the whole thing so far back into his memory that it might easily have been just a dream. But now this letter had brought it all out again and it was so real, so hard in his mind that he wondered how he’d ever managed to push it away at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Are you all right, Jim?’ it was Martha again, her hand on his shoulder. He could see her face leaning in close to his, her features very Indian and yet, at the same time, very Spanish. Dark eyes and brown skin and black hair. Something in the shape of her face reminded him of a girl he had seen once in Madrigueras. A little scrap of a thing dressed in rags. She must have been freezing, standing there in her bare feet, with the winter wind swirling papers and dust along the filthy streets."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘I’m alright, Martha,’ Jim said, but he couldn’t get that little girl’s face out of his mind. He remembered they were sitting outside the bullring in Madrigueras, where Andre Marty, the Commissar of the International Brigades, had just addressed the whole British Battalion. Marty had told them they would win a great victory for communism; that fascism would be wiped out in Spain. Then he and his staff had got into their car and drove back to Albacete while the men trickled out of the bullring and wondered what would happen next. Jim and Peter Hurley had found a spot to sit and share a cigarette. They’d only got one lit when they noticed this little girl standing across the street, staring at them."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Look at her, poor little mite,’ Peter had said. ‘She must be starving,’ he dug deep in the pockets of his overalls. The rations they got weren’t very good, but they’d only been here a few weeks and some of them still had a few of the luxuries they’d brought out with them. Peter pulled out a chunk of chocolate with bits of the silver paper embedded in it."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Here,’ he said, holding it out to the girl, but she didn’t move. She kept staring straight at them. Her face was like a mask."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Here, go on. Have some,’ Peter shook the chocolate at her. ‘Food… chocolato. Go on, it’s good.’"
msgstr ""

msgid "The girl shook her head, but she didn’t move. She kept standing there, staring at them."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Suit yourself,’ Peter said, and he broke off a piece of the chocolate and put it in his mouth. ‘It’s your loss,’ he said, chewing."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘I don’t think she likes you,’ Jim observed, laughing, but then the little girl seemed to come to life. She clenched her fist and raised her skinny arm."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Viva la Brigada International!’ she squeaked, and ran off. Jim and Peter looked at each other for a moment. Then they burst out laughing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Martha squeezed his shoulder again, bringing him back to his little kitchen, to the letter in front of him. Martha was looking at it, frowning. Jim wondered if she was able to read it, if it meant anything to her."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘What’s the matter, Jim?’ she asked. ‘Is it the letter? Is it bad news?’"
msgstr ""

msgid "‘No, Martha,’ Jim shook his head and patted her hand on his shoulder. ‘Not bad news, just bad memories.’"
msgstr ""

msgid "After Martha left, Jim went and sat in his armchair in the front room. He left the letter on the kitchen table but the memories followed him. When he closed his eyes for a few moments he saw long grass waving in a cold wind. He could feel the sun on his face but there was no heat in it. There was smoke in the air and he could feel the crushed grass prickling under his hands as he pushed himself up, straining to see, and yet afraid of what he might see. Fzzzt! Something went whipping past his head and he ducked down, but made himself get up once more. Fzzt! Fzzt!"
msgstr ""

msgid "When his eyes opened they went straight to the painting on the wall of the front room. It was a small landscape on a plain rectangle of canvas and Jim had painted it himself. Mary had enrolled him in a painting course after he retired from his job with the Council. He wouldn’t have bothered himself - all his working life, he said, he’d been painting doors and windows and walls. Why would he want to learn how to paint pictures? But Mary had said he should at least try. He had time on his hands, he should see if he had any gift for the artistic side of things."
msgstr ""

msgid "Looking at the fruit of his labours, it was clear to him that he had no such gift, but Mary had liked that picture. She had said it was perfect, as good as anything in the National Gallery, and she had given it pride of place in her good front room. After she died, Jim had left it there to remind him of her, and of what a terrible liar she had been."
msgstr ""

msgid "The picture showed a broad valley with a thick, brown-flecked river snaking along the bottom. The uneven ground had patches of bare rock and sand, scrubby trees and rocks. The sky was very blue. Most of the class had worked their landscapes from postcards or photographs, but not Jim. His view of the valley had been in his mind and it had been bothering him more and more now that, as Mary had said, he had time on his hands. The teacher had been curious, had asked him where it was, but Jim had just said he didn’t know; he was old, he couldn’t remember – it must have been some place he’d seen. The teacher’s eye had been drawn to the little rounded humps Jim had painted in the grassy foreground. What were they? Were they rocks? They were rocks, Jim had agreed, though they were olive colored rocks and strangely shaped. The teacher had pointed to one of them with the end of a brush, said that one looked like it had an arm. He’d seemed amused by this, had chuckled to himself and then moved on. Jim had carefully painted out the shapes in the foreground, until the grass looked like they had never been there at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "Jim heard footsteps coming along the street outside. It was a quiet street and not many people passed, but he thought he recognized the rhythm of these steps. A shadow went passed the window and, sure enough, there was the rattle of a key in the front door. From his armchair, Jim had a clear view of the hall, and he saw his granddaughter step through the door and wave to him as she pulled her key from the lock."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Hi granddad!’ She was all business – came straight to him after she shut the door. Gillian was his youngest grandchild – the only child of his youngest daughter. He remembered the first time she came into this house, just a little speck of a thing all swaddled in the blanket Mary had knitted for her. He remembered thinking she’d had her grandmother’s eyes, and this memory gave him a little jolt of sadness. She looked even more like Mary now, he thought, though her hair was darker and shorter, and she was much taller. Here she was kneeling down beside him, grown to a young woman; twenty-seven years old, long legged and lithe."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Martha called me, granddad,’ she said, taking his hand and looking into his face. ‘She said you weren’t in good form – she was worried about you.’"
msgstr ""

msgid "These women fretting over him, Jim thinks – and whispering about him behind his back. But he is glad of their concern. He feels so lonely at his age – so very much alone, now that most of the people he had known and loved were dead – that he is comforted by the thought of somebody being worried about him. If nothing else, it means he will be missed when he is gone."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘I’m alright, love,’ he said, patting her worried hand. ‘It’s nothing to worry about.’"
msgstr ""

msgid "‘She said you got a letter. Was there something in it that upset you, granddad?’"
msgstr ""

msgid "‘No,’ he told her, but his eyes were cast down. He didn’t even believe it himself. Gillian smiled at him, but got up and, without a word, went into the kitchen. She saw the letter straight away and read it standing by the table. She noted the date at the top, and then read it through again. It didn’t seem like a joke and, besides, she knew about Spain. She knew he had been there."
msgstr ""

msgid "She wasn’t supposed to, of course. It was the family secret – the thing that everybody knew but nobody talked about. From a very young age she understood that her grandfather had been in Spain, but that she was never to ask him about it. As she grew up she learned that there had been a war and that he had fought in it. Her curiosity was fired. Why had he gone all the way to Spain to fight in a war? And why had there been a war in Spain? When she was a girl, Spain had been a place of beaches and big hotels, of sun and swimming pools. She couldn’t think what they might have to fight about, still less why her grandfather would want to fight with the Spanish. Then somebody – aunt, uncle or cousin – told her he was a socialist; that he had gone to Spain to fight for the workers and for the republic. This only confused Gillian even more."
msgstr ""

msgid "But still the injunction stood. Her mother, who was lax in almost everything else, stood firm on this; she was not to ask her grandfather about Spain. As Gillian grew up she learned about the Spanish Civil War at school, but was dismayed to learn it was overshadowed by the world war that followed directly after it. Her grandfather had not fought in that war, he had fought in the one in Spain. She was proud of him, but she wasn’t sure why. So, she had learned about the war, about it’s causes and the outcome. When she read about the International Brigades, she had peered closely at the photographs of the young men in their leather jackets and berets, looking for one who might have been her grandfather sixty years before. She had studied those photographs over and over again; she had even used a magnifying glass to look for him, but she had never found him. But she had never stopped believing he had been there, even though she wasn’t allowed to ask him."
msgstr ""

msgid "When she finished reading the letter for the second time she folded it up and slid it back into the envelope. Then she made up her mind. She walked back into the front room and sat in the other chair, the one where her grandmother used to sit. But she didn’t relax in that chair. She perched on the edge and leaned forward, her elbows on her knees."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Grandad,’ she said, looking him in the eye. ‘I think it’s time we talked about Spain, don’t you?’"
msgstr ""

msgid "*"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gillian worked in a restaurant and had done ever since she was a student. Back then she’d been a waitress and now she was a sort of part manager, part Maitre D. It had been a temporary arrangement when she started, and was still temporary four years later. Just until something better comes along, she often told herself. But nothing better had come along. Now she had a master’s degree in modern history and a sheaf of rejection letters. Thank you for seeing us… we’re sorry we can’t offer you the post at this time… we will keep your application on file… And so on, and so forth."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tonight her mind wasn’t on her work. She was thinking of what her grandfather had said to her when she had sat down with him to talk about the letter. After all these years of being forbidden to talk to him about it, Gillian had found it surprisingly easy to get the information from him. Yes, he had gone to Spain and he had fought there for the Spanish republic. This much she knew. But in his soft, ancient voice, he’d also told her why he had gone, and why he had fought."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Those were hard times,’ he’d said, looking at her wistfully. He knew she hated being told how easy young people had it, but it was true. ‘There was real poverty in Dublin in those days. People starved on the streets. And jobs were different to how they are now. Half the men working were casual – they worked from one day to the next, and never knew if their job would be there tomorrow.’"
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Is that how it was for you, grandad?’"
msgstr ""

msgid "‘No, I had it better than some, I suppose. Straight after I left school I got a start with a firm of painters. It was a decent enough job, but they wouldn’t have a union man and I was involved with the union. The minute they found out they gave me the sack and then I went to work for the union full time, as an organiser. I was a bit political, you see, even though I was only a youngfella. I was in the Labour party and I fancied myself as a bit of a socialist – I read everything James Connolly ever wrote, and I thought we could turn Ireland into a worker’s paradise. But Ireland back then was no place for socialists. The church had the whole country in it’s grip, and they thought a socialist was the same as a communist and a communist denied God. Then there were the blueshirts. Have you heard of the blueshirts?’"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gillian nodded. She had heard of the blueshirts; Irish fascists, modelled after Mussolini’s Blackshirts and Hitler’s Brownshirts. But it was one thing to read about them in books and another to hear her own grandfather tell her of his battles with them, of the vicious attacks on strikes and union rallies. She could hardly believe she was living in the same country where these thugs had been lauded as stalwarts of public decency and socialists like her grandfather had been denounced as evil and godless."
msgstr ""

msgid "But she had felt proud to hear him talk about it. To know that he had stood up to them even though it had cost him his job, and God knew what else besides. To know that he had gone to Spain, which must have seemed so much further away than it did now, and fought for something he believed in. It made her feel proud, but also slightly ashamed of herself. What did she believe in? What did she have to fight for? The door of the restaurant opened and a young couple walked in, holding hands. Gillian smiled at them. Table for two? She wondered if they had ever heard of the Blueshirts. What did they know about hardship, about fighting for a decent life? But she showed them to a table, handed them menus, smiled and took their order for drinks. She hadn’t even turned away before they resumed the conversation they’d been having when they came in the door."
msgstr ""

msgid "She gave their order to one of the waiters and then went back to her station near the door. This job was too easy, too familiar. She knew everybody who worked here by name, she knew every table, every plate, almost. She got free lunch and dinner and as many leftovers as she wanted. She hoped she wouldn’t be here in a year but she’d held onto that hope ever since she’d started. She was better than this, but sometimes she felt like screaming."
msgstr ""

msgid "Usually she’d make a round of the tables and ask the customers if everything was to their liking, but not tonight. It was a quiet night and she had her grandfather on her mind. She’d asked him, almost as an afterthought, if he would go to Greece to accept his award. He’d said no, he was too old. But that wasn’t it. She knew him too well. There was something in the emphatic tone that he’d used that made her think it was more than just old age that was holding him back."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘How would I get to Greece, at my age?’ he had asked, as if he wasn’t the same man who had given everything up at nineteen years of age and taken boat and bus and God-knew-what all the way to Spain, where there was a war on."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘You could be there in a couple of hours, grandad,’ she had said, but then she’d pictured him in the airport, an old, old man, a little deaf and unsteady on his feet, dealing with all the crowds and computers. She’d tried to think if he’d ever even been on a plane before."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘No,’ he’d said, shaking his head. ‘No, it wouldn’t be right.’"
msgstr ""

msgid "It wouldn’t be right? What had he meant by that? She puzzled over it for a moment, but then the door opened and another couple came into the restaurant. Gillian smiled at them."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Table for two?’ she asked."
msgstr ""

msgid "That night Jim went to bed early. He tried not to, but he knew the moment he settled into his chair that he wouldn’t be able to rest easy. He found himself staring at that picture of Spain as the room grew dark around him. He started to hear the rustle of the grass in the dry breeze and voices whispering to him in English and Spanish. By eight o’clock he’d had enough and he pushed himself up out of the armchair and leaned on his stick and started the long journey up the stairs."
msgstr ""

msgid "It wasn’t as fraught going up as coming down, but it was hard work and he always felt a bit dizzy by the time he got to the landing. He shuffled into the bedroom, small, stuffy and quiet, just the ticking of the clock in the darkness. Time passing, tick-tock. But he didn’t go to bed. He went to the wardrobe and opened the door and then, ever so slowly, with his knees creaking and his ankles grinding, he knelt down."
msgstr ""

msgid "The box was at the very back of the wardrobe, an old shoe box under a mound of folded clothes and unworn shoes. Jim pulled it out carefully then turned and used the bed to pull himself up. It was nearly more than he could manage, but he eventually got himself sitting on the edge of the bed, the box in his lap. Then he was afraid to open it. Pandora’s box – wasn’t that the one with the troubles of all mankind in it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "With a deep breath he steeled himself and took off the lid. His first feeling was disappointment at how little there was in the box – it was much less than he had thought. But how long was it since he had looked? Years, decades, even. It seemed like the years had eaten away at the contents, and all he could see as he looked into the box were a few photographs and a dog-eared notebook."
msgstr ""

msgid "But when he opened the notebook a long piece of red ribbon fell out and he smiled as he picked it up and twisted it through his fingers. For the life of him, he couldn’t think of the name of the girl it had belonged to. A militiawoman, as strong as a horse and deadly with a rifle, and yet somehow hanging onto her femininity with little things like this ribbon. She had smiled at him once and kissed him later and then given him this ribbon to remember her by. That was all he had of her, except for the memory of her face, with her high cheekbones and dark eyes and the coal-black hair she had tied up with this ribbon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Gently, Jim tucked the ribbon back into the notebook and took the photographs from the box. They were all black and white, all cracked and faded and yellowed at the edges. The first one showed three of them grinning at the camera, squinting in the bright sun and with their caps pushed back on their heads, their shirtsleeves rolled up. Jim could just about make out his younger self standing on the left, his hands planted on his hips, chest out and head tilted at a jaunty angle. It must have been taken early in the war, Jim thought, looking at his own open face, his grin and his laughing eyes. They didn’t even have a rifle between them at that stage and they had no idea what they were letting themselves in for. He didn’t recognise the man in the middle of the photograph, but the one on the right was his friend, Peter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Poor Peter. He couldn’t even think of him now without putting that word in front of his name. Poor Peter; he looked even younger than Jim did in that photograph – barely more than a boy. And you could tell from the picture that he’d had a hard life. His bony limbs and the bulge of his belly, that indefinable look in his eyes – they all said that he’d grown up hungry."
msgstr ""

msgid "Poor Peter. A few weeks after that photograph was taken he was dead, lying in the rustling grass near the Jarama river with a hole in his chest and his eyes open wide to the sky. Jim could remember the very moment it had happened. They’d been running together, running for their lives from an enemy they could hardly even see. Jim could remember his heart thudding in his chest like it was fit to burst, the pounding of his feet and the mad mixture of fear and exhileration that drove him forward. He could hardly feel the ground as he ran, nor the weight of the rifle in his hand."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then they both fell down together. Jim had tripped on a rock, a branch, something. The fall jarred him, knocked the wind out of him, but he was up almost as fast as he went down, snatching up the rifle and barely looking back at his friend. But that glance, half taken, was enough to stop him in his tracks. There was something about the way Peter lay, the stillness of him, that told Jim all he needed to know."
msgstr ""

msgid "He knelt down beside his friend and for a few moments was heedless of the danger, of the bullets flying past him. Fzzt, fzzt. He looked at Peter. He wanted to touch him, but he was afraid to. Poor Peter. He was the one who had brought Jim here, he was the true socialist. He’d said it was worth the fight, that they had to do something to stop the fascists before they strangled all of Europe. And now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Jim’s hand was shaking and tears were welling in his eyes. He dropped the rest of the photographs into the box. He couldn’t look at any more. What had it all been for? All that killing, all that death? They hadn’t stopped the fascists. It had taken another six years to stop them. And then, what came after... it hadn’t been fascism, but it hadn’t been socialism, either. It had been business as usual, at least for the capitalists, for the banks and the brokers and the bosses."
msgstr ""

msgid "Jim’s shoulders sagged over his box of hidden memories. He’d had a happy life; it had been hard by times, and never prosperous, but he’d raised a family with a woman he loved and he couldn’t have asked for better than that. But all those years he’d felt a shadow at his shoulder. No matter how hard he had tried to forget, no matter how hard he had tried to keep the past behind him, he had always felt it pressing him, prodding him, tugging at him. Demanding to know what he had done, what he had given, what sacrifice he had made."
msgstr ""

msgid "That first picture was still in his hand and he blinked away the tears and made himself look at it. Peter’s face smiled back at him, young and incorruptible. Poor Peter, he thought, again. Poor, poor Peter.	"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gillian didn’t come on Wednesday, but on Thursday she brought food. Leftovers were one of the perks of working at the restaurant and God knew she needed them sometimes, because the money didn’t go far. Today she had chicken and bread and chorizo sausage. This last item was fortuitous because she’d been thinking about Spain. She’d thought about it almost non-stop ever since she’d talked to her grandfather about it; ever since he’d told her no, he wouldn’t go and be honoured for what he had done. She had made up her mind to talk to him today. To make him lunch and try to convince him to go to Athens."
msgstr ""

msgid "She let herself in as usual, closing the front door with a bump of her hip. The door to the sitting room was open, but she could see his chair was empty. The house was silent."

msgid "‘Grandad?’ she called out. She always felt a little uneasy when she stepped into this hallway. He was so old that she knew it was only a matter of time before somebody found him..."

msgstr ""

msgid "‘I’m all right,’ he answered, half smiling. She couldn’t be sure, but she thought he looked more tired than usual, a little worn out. She wondered if she ought to put off asking him about Spain, but then her eyes fell on the battered shoe box on the table in front of him."
